## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use [google](https://www.google.com/) to google stuff.

Or you can just look at this picture of a grizzly bear [picture](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA-tyzm-PYAhVDKKwKHYtADNoQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fnature%2F453765%2FI-m-not-such-a-grizzly-bear-cub-gives-a-wave-in-adorable-snapshot&psig=AOvVaw3JaBbOcBwjtDLNVPaJUdak&ust=1516423353297619) to see what a bear really looks like.

### I don't think I want to use this theme.  I think I want to make my own theme.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mrmoeller/mrmoeller.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
