## Welcome to my website, my dude

You can use [google](https://www.google.com/) to google stuff.

Or you can just look at this video of a grizzly bear [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6Xo21L0ybE) to see what a bear really looks like.

### Title

This is an example inside the title.  We're using something called Markdown.
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [this link right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4).

### I don't think I want to use this theme.  I think I want to make my own theme.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mrmoeller/mrmoeller.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
